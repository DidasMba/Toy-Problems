# Python Toy Problems

This repository contains Python solutions to three toy problems. Each challenge is implemented as a separate function.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Given an hour (1 to 12), minute (0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm"), the `convert_to_24_hour` function returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.

The `two_positive` function takes three integers (a, b, c) as arguments and returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers, and False otherwise.

### Challenge 3: Consonant value

The `solve` function takes a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only and no spaces. It returns the highest value of consonant substrings, where consonants are any letters except "aeiou".

## Usage

You can test the functions by calling them with different inputs in a Python script or interactive environment.

Example:

```python
print(convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am"))
print(two_positive(2, 4, -3))
print(solve("zodiacs"))
